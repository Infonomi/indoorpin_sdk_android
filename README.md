IndoorpinSDK is used for the mobile integration of Indoorpin CMS. It is strongly recommended to start with quick start part described in CMS (cms.indoorpin.com) Quick Start provides a demo app in the app store so you do not need to deal with SDK at first. 

**After quick start you can start using SDK.**

**STEP 1:**
```
sign up to CMS from cms.indoorpin.com 
Create an application in CMS in application page with "com.infonomi.sampleapp" bundle id and copy the api key.
```
**STEP 2:**
```
Create a branch in CMS (cms.indoorpin.com) in branches page
```
**STEP 3:**
```
Add a floor plan to the added branch in step 2 in CMS in branches page. You have to provide a floor plan image in this step. A sample floor plan image can be found here: https://goo.gl/Tky5ot 
```

**STEP 4:**
```
Add your iBeacon device in Beacon page in CMS. Locate the beacon device on the floor plan you created in step 3.
```

**STEP 5:**
```
Add a campaign in Campaign page in CMS. Select the beacon device you created in step 4. 
``` 

**STEP 6:**
```
Open Eclipse, File > Import > Existing Android Code Into Workspace > Select Project Folder > Finish
```

**STEP 7:**
```
In src/com/infonomi/sampleapp/MainActivity.java file replace PUT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE with the API key that you've copied in step 1.
```

**STEP 8:**
```
Build and run SampleApp on the device.
```

**STEP 9:**
```
Open CMS live map page and see whether you can see Taylor Swift on the floor plan for the application Sample App.
While the sample app is running you will receive push notifications and popups according to your campaign setup
In CMS analytics page, you will be able to see heatmap and analytics data in different formats on the floor plan.
```

**Integrating IndoorpinSdk To Your Own Mobile App:**

**STEP 1:**
```
Add the jar files in your project folder libs
```
**STEP 2:**

Create an indoorpin user class as following:
```
indoorPinUser = new IndoorPinUser(
				null, //Fill this if you want to track the customer with your own database customer id. If this is the case, you should set userDB tof your application to YES in CMS
				"Taylor", 
				"Swift", 
				"http://topnews.in/light/files/taylor-swift_6.jpg?1424841363", 
				"taylorswift@gmail.com", 
				IndoorPinUser.IPGENDER_FEMALE, 
				"1980-01-30" // "yyyy-mm-dd"
		); 
```
```
All of the user data are optional values. If you do not provide name/surname the user will be displayed as anonymous user. If you want to track your users with the userId that you already have in your own database, then fill in the userId and select userDB=yes for your application in CMS else leave it empty.
```
**STEP 3:**

Initialize sdk with the following code:
```
indoorPinSDK = new IndoorPinSDK(this, this);
//PUT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE  You can see your Api Key in CMS Applications page
indoorPinSDK.init(indoorPinUser, PUT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE, new IPCallback() {
	
	@Override
	public void successful() {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		
	}
});
```
**STEP 4:**
```
@Override
protected void onStart() {
	super.onStart();
	IndoorPinSDK.bind = true; //if the application is running in the foreground, popups can be displayed.
}

@Override
protected void onStop() {
	super.onStop();
	IndoorPinSDK.bind = false; //if the application is running in the background, notification can be displayed.
}
```
You should implement IndoorPinDelegate in the Activity or Fragment file

**STEP 5:**

If you want to add the indoornavigation module :
```
...
indoorPinSDK = new IndoorPinSDK(this, this);
//PUT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE  You can see your Api Key in CMS Applications page
indoorPinSDK.init(indoorPinUser, "36e5ecb5-2ffe-4256-b435-41f838a3e23b", new IPCallback() {
	@Override
	public void successful() {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		iPNavigationView = new IPNavigationView(a, null);
		setContentView(iPNavigationView.getView());
		//|| rootView.addView(indoorNavigationView) || layout.addView(indoorNavigationView)
	}
});
...

@Override
public void didChangeBeacon(IndoorPinBeacon indoorPinBeacon) {
	// TODO Auto-generated method stub
	iPNavigationView.didChangeBeacon(indoorPinBeacon);
}
```
This will display the current floor plan with blue circle on it.

**STEP 6:**

In your project's AndroidManifest.xml file add the following:
```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" /> 
```	
This will give your application the internet and bluetooth permissions for listening to beacon signals
