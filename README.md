IndoorpinSDK is used for the mobile integration of Indoorpin CMS. It is strongly recommended to start with quick start part described in CMS (cms.indoorpin.com) Quick Start provides a demo app in the app store so you do not need to deal with SDK at first. 

After quick start you can start using SDK. 

STEP 1:

sign up to CMS from cms.indoorpin.com 
Create an application in CMS in application page with "com.infonomi.sampleapp" bundle id and copy the api key.

STEP 2:

Create a branch in CMS (cms.indoorpin.com) in branches page

STEP 3:

Add a floor plan to the added branch in step 2 in CMS in branches page. You have to provide a floor plan image in this step. A sample floor plan image can be found here: https://goo.gl/Tky5ot
